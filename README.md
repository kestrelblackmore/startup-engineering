## Stanford Startup Engineering

These are **my** solutions to the homework for the **Stanford Startup Engineering Course** that started June 2013. The course was run on CourseRA. (https://www.coursera.org/course/startup)

#### Week 1

- week1_part1.js (Simply output some text to the console)
- week1_part2.js (Calculate the first 100 prime numbers)

#### Week 2

No programming this week. Instead had to review a program and answer a quiz.
